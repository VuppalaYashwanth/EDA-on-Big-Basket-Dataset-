### For Interviews:
**Sample Answer to "Tell me about a project..."**

"I completed a comprehensive retail analytics project analyzing BigBasket sales data. I worked with 41,748 transactions across 649 products, using SQL for data aggregation and Python for analysis.

The key challenge was understanding the relationship between discounting strategy and revenue. I wrote 12 complex SQL queries to analyze category performance, pricing patterns, and regional distribution.

My findings revealed that products in the ₹200-500 range drove 53.8% of revenue, and discounts above 20% increased transaction value by 38%. I also identified that Cleaning & Household category generated 23.6% of total revenue.

I delivered the insights through an Excel dashboard and stakeholder report with specific recommendations: optimizing inventory for top 50 products, implementing strategic 15-20% discounts, and focusing on the Central region which was underperforming by 1.5%.

The project demonstrates my ability to work with large datasets, perform complex analysis, and communicate insights to business stakeholders."
